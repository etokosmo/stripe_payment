## Configurations

* Python version: 3.10
* Libraries: [requirements.txt](https://github.com/etokosmo/foodplan/blob/main/requirements.txt)

## Launch

### Local server

- Download code
- Through the console in the directory with the code, install the virtual environment with the command:
```bash
python3 -m venv env
```

- Activate the virtual environment with the command:
```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

- Install the libraries with the command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Write the environment variables in the `.env` file in the format KEY=VALUE

`SECRET_KEY` - A secret key for a particular Django installation. This is used to provide cryptographic signing, and should be set to a unique, unpredictable value.

`ALLOWED_HOSTS` - A list of strings representing the host/domain names that this Django site can serve. This is a security measure to prevent HTTP Host header attacks, which are possible even under many seemingly-safe web server configurations.

`DEBUG` - A boolean that turns on/off debug mode. If your app raises an exception when DEBUG is True, Django will display a detailed traceback, including a lot of metadata about your environment, such as all the currently defined Django settings (from settings.py).

`DATABASE_URL` - URL to db. For more information check [this](https://github.com/jazzband/dj-database-url).

`STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` - Stripe public API key. For more information check [this](https://stripe.com/docs/keys).

`STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Stripe secret API key. For more information check [this](https://stripe.com/docs/keys).

- Create your database with the command:
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

- Run local server with the command (it will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000/):
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
